# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enhance the existing CampaignSeederService to automatically copy all Character records from the Master Campaign when a new campaign is created, providing gamemasters with immediate access to established NPCs and example enemies. This utilizes the existing CharacterDuplicator service and executes automatically during campaign creation without user intervention.
