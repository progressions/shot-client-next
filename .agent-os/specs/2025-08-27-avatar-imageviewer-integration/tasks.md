## Implementation Notes

- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Start with core entities (Character, Fight) as they are most frequently used
- Ensure consistent implementation across all Avatar components
- Use existing ImageViewer component without modifications
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Avatar APIs
- Focus on accessibility from the beginning, not as an afterthought
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices throughout development
